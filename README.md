# EDA, Visualization, and House Value Prediction Model

## Overview
This project analyzes California housing price data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques to uncover key insights into housing prices. A predictive model is built using Linear Regression and Random Forest to estimate house values based on historical data. The repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used for analysis and modeling, along with a PDF report documenting the projectâ€™s methodology and findings.

## Project Contents
